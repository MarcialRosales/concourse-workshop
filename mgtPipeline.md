- [Pipeline dashboards](#topics-1)


## <a name="topic-1"></a> Pipeline dashboards

We can view multiple pipelines in a single wide screen using a tool like http://ifg.cfapps.io/. We can use this tool to create a mosaic of pipelines.

1. go to `http://ifg.cfapps.io/`
2. click "new grid"
3. click "+" icon at the right bottom corner of the page
4. enter url for each iframe we want to include in the grid. you can customize the shape of each iframe.
5. click "save" icon at the right bottom corner of the page
6. you are done!

There is another tool which creates an index dashboard of pipelines . I have deployed to Solera (dashboard.apps-dev.chdc20-cf.solera.com) as a PCF app but it is very slow.
